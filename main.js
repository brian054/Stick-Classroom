/*

What we need to figure out
- Window dim's
- Player Sprite
- Controls
- Collision with desks and walls
- Teacher AI
- Levels

Separate Project Idea:
Hmmmm now I'm thinking 2d tile rpg right - hmmm we 
could do a more story driven thing there - like an rpg
where you go through and cheat your way through school - bet.
    - TODO: 2d TileRPG engine in JS, 2d RPG in MonoGame, pick whichever you like more
